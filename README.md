# OpenAnt

OpenAnt from [Knostic](https://knostic.ai) is an open source LLM-based vulnerability discovery product that helps defenders proactively find verified security flaws while minimizing both false positives and false negatives. Stage 1 detects. Stage 2 attacks. What survives is real.

We're pretty proud of this product and are in the disclosure process for its findings, but do keep in mind that this started as a research project with some of its features still in beta, and we welcome contributions to make it better.

## Why open source?
Considering the explosion of AI-discovered vulnerabilities, we hope OpenAnt will be the tool helping open source maintainers stay ahead of attackers, where they can use it themselves or submit their repo for scanning at no cost.

Then, since Knostic's focus is on protecting agents and coding assistants and not vulnerability research or application security, and we like open source, we decided to release OpenAnt under the Apache 2 license.
Besides, you may have heard about Aardvark from OpenAI (now Codex Security) and Claude Code Security from Anthropic, and we have zero intention of competing with them.

## Local setup

Build the CLI binary (requires Go 1.25+):

```bash
cd apps/openant-cli && make build
```

This compiles the Go source and outputs the binary to `apps/openant-cli/bin/openant`.

Symlink it onto your PATH so you can run `openant` from anywhere:

```bash
ln -sf "$(pwd)/apps/openant-cli/bin/openant" /usr/local/bin/openant
```

_Note: run this from the repo root so `$(pwd)` resolves to the correct absolute path._

Set your Anthropic API key (required for analyze, verify, and scan):

```bash
openant set-api-key <your-key>
```

**The key must have access to the Claude Opus 4.6 model.** Get a key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

## Data directories

OpenAnt creates two directories:

- **`~/.config/openant/`** — CLI configuration (`config.json`). Stores your API key, active project, and preferences. File permissions are restricted to `0600`.
- **`~/.openant/`** — Project data. Each initialized project gets a workspace under `~/.openant/projects/<org>/<repo>/` containing `project.json` and a `scans/` directory with per-commit outputs.

## Analyzing a project

### 1. Initialize

Point OpenAnt at a repository. The `-l` flag (language) is required — use `go` or `python`.

```bash
# Remote — clones the repo
openant init <repo-url> -l go

# Remote — pin to a specific commit
openant init <repo-url> -l go --commit <sha>

# Local — references the directory in-place
openant init <path-to-repo> -l go --name <org/repo>
```

This creates a project workspace and sets it as the active project. All subsequent commands operate on the active project automatically — no path arguments needed.

### 2. Run the pipeline

Each step picks up the output of the previous one from the project's scan directory:

```bash
openant parse
openant enhance
openant analyze
openant verify
openant build-output
openant report -f summary
```

Or run the full pipeline in one command:

```bash
openant scan --verify
```

### Working with multiple projects

The pipeline operates on one project at a time. Running `openant init` sets the newly initialized project as the active one, so all subsequent commands target it by default.

If you're working with several projects, you have two options:

```bash
# Option 1: switch the active project
openant project switch org/repo
openant parse

# Option 2: target a project directly with -p
openant parse -p org/repo
```

### Project management

```bash
openant project list              # shows all projects, marks active
openant project show              # details of active project
openant project switch <org/repo> # switch active project
```
